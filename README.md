# Ai4CHD

## Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD), including its acute manifestation, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early identification and differentiation of stable CHD, ACS, and normal individuals is critical for reducing the global burden of CHD. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on invasive procedures or have limited accuracy in predicting disease progression. In this study, we present a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach to diagnose stable CHD and ACS using electronic health records (EHR) data.By leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, we developed predictive models that integrate clinical, demographic, and laboratory variables from EHR data to accurately distinguish between stable CHD, ACS, and healthy individuals. The models were trained and validated using a comprehensive dataset collected from the National Healthcare Big Data (Eastern) Center, comprising 6,787 patient records from 129 medical institutions in Jiangsu Province, China. Advanced models, including the T2GFormer with Optimizable-Weights-Loss (OWL), demonstrated superior performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.963 and macro-F1 score of 0.768 on the external temporal test set. Model interpretability was enhanced through the use of SHAP values, providing transparency into the contribution of individual clinical variables. Our findings demonstrate that AI models trained on routinely collected EHR data can effectively diagnose CHD and ACS, offering a scalable solution for early detection and clinical decision support.
