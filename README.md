# Ai4CHD

## Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD), including its acute manifestation, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early identification and differentiation of stable CHD, ACS, and normal individuals is critical for reducing the global burden of CHD. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on invasive procedures or have limited accuracy in predicting disease progression. 

Ai4CHD is an AI-driven approach leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze electronic health records (EHR) data, integrating clinical, demographic, and laboratory variables. The aim is to accurately distinguish between stable CHD, ACS, and healthy individuals, aiding early diagnosis and treatment.

## Features
AI models for diagnosing stable CHD, ACS, and healthy individuals.
EHR-based predictive analysis using structured clinical, demographic, and laboratory data.
Machine learning and deep learning models tailored for clinical decision support.
Scalable and adaptable to new datasets or healthcare systems.

## Installation
